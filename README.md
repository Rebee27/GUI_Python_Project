# GUI_Python_Project

This project was done during the ARRK workshop, within the FutureUp project.
The main task was to extract data from tazz.ro, such as cities that tazz is partner with and the info of restaurants for each city (name of the restaurant, description and rating).
I implemented an Extractor class to extract this data and save it in a json file.
In the MainView file we have the RestaurantTable class that displays all the partner cities together their restaurants.
The MainView class implements the first window that contains a data extraction button, a progress bar, a button to display all the cities with its restaurants and a search section, where you can search for a specific city and display its restaurants.
